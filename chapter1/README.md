AI: generic term that means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.
machine learning: data and expected answers in, rules come out.  trained instead of programmed.
deep learning: almost always use neural networks.  DL uses layers stacked on top of one and other.  Each layer, the data undergoes some kind of transformation.
Weights: numbers that determine the layers prediction. 
loss function: aka objective function - calculates the difference between the expected outcome and the models prediction.
Optimizer: uses the score calculated by the loss function to update the parameters.  this is called Back Propagation.
